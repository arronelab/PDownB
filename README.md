# PDownB

The RCSB PDB was searched for crystal structures to sample. Crystal structures were used instead of NMR models to simplify the data analysis process; NMR structures often contain multiple models that could be problematic to process.

The criteria for PDB sampling were:

- Resolution > 2 Ã…
- Chain length 30 - 300 residues
- Remove redundancy by using representative structures at 70 % sequence identity (i.e. use one structure to represent all lysozymes).

The search produced **2367 entries** for which the coordinate (pdb) files were downloaded for analysis.
- **PDB**: the PDB files as they were submitted to the RCSB PDB for each protein.
- **CA**: the alpha-carbon backbone for each protein. If the protein has multiple chains, we selected the first available chain.
- **XYZ**: the xyz-coordinate files for the backbone curves of each protein.
- **SSE**: the secondary structure classification for each protein, where "-" denotes linker, "H" denotes alpha-helix, and "S" denotes beta-sheets.
- **Down**: the xyz-coordinate files for the downsampled proteins. The downsampling reduces the protein to just the endpoints of each secondary structure element.
- **DownSSE**: the secondary structure classification for each downsampled protein, where "-" denotes linker, "H" denotes alpha-helix, and "S" denotes beta-sheets.
- **Writhes**: the writhe data of each downsampled protein in the format: *Subsection Length* | *Writhe*. We start from length 5 (the smallest possible to calculate the writhe) and increase in steps of 3.

*Note: There are only 2333 entries in the downsampled case, as some proteins when downsampled were then too short to calculate a writhe for.*

- **curvature_torsion_calculator.py**: the script used to calculate the curvature-torsion distribution of the proteins in **PDB**. *Requires [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Biopython](https://biopython.org/).*
- **curvature_torsion_analysis.csv**: the output of **curvature_torsion_calculator.py** in the format: *Chain* | *Subsection* | *Curvature* | *Torsion*

It is possible to get distributions for each secondary structure element using [DSSP](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/). If this is something you are interested in then please get in touch for more details.
