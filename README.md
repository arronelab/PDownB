# PDownB

The RCSB PDB was searched for crystal structures to sample. Crystal structures were used instead of NMR models to simplify the data analysis process; NMR structures often contain multiple models that could be problematic to process.

The criteria for PDB sampling were:

- Resolution > 2 Ã…
-RWork between 0-0.20
-RFree between 0-0.25
-Chain length 30 - 300 residues
-No ligands
-Minimum 2 alpha helices (is this too low??)
-Remove redundancy by using representative structures at 70 % sequence identity (i.e. use one structure to represent all lysozymes).
